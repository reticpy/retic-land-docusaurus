The ``Next`` [class](https://retic.land/manual/glossary#clase "Glosario de TÃ©rminos") allows control of the request to be passed to the next controller. It is often used in the development of middleware or logic for the exchange of information.
  
```python

# Retic
from retic import Request, Response, Next
from retic.services.responses import error_response
from retic.services.validations import validate_obligate_fields

# Services
from services.users.users as users

def oauth(req: Request, res: Response, next:Next):

    """Authenticate the user"""
    _user = users.validate(req.headers.get('authorization'))

    if _user["valid"] is False:
        return res.forbidden()

    # Continue with the next middleware
    next()

```
